Given a table of candidates and their skills, you're tasked with finding the candidates best suited for an open Data Science job. You want to find candidates who are proficient in Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL.

Write a query to list the candidates who possess all of the required skills for the job. Sort the output by candidate ID in ascending order.

Assumption:

There are no duplicates in the candidates table.
candidates Table:
Column Name	Type
candidate_id	integer
skill	varchar
candidates Example Input:
candidate_id	skill
123	Python
123	Tableau
123	PostgreSQL
234	R
234	PowerBI
234	SQL Server
345	Python
345	Tableau
Example Output:
candidate_id
123
Explanation
Candidate 123 is displayed because they have Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL skills. 345 isn't included in the output because they're missing one of the required skills: PostgreSQL.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

Tesla is investigating production bottlenecks and they need your help to extract the relevant data. Write a query to determine which parts have begun the assembly process but are not yet finished.

Assumptions:

parts_assembly table contains all parts currently in production, each at varying stages of the assembly process.
An unfinished part is one that lacks a finish_date.
This question is straightforward, so let's approach it with simplicity in both thinking and solution.

Effective April 11th 2023, the problem statement and assumptions were updated to enhance clarity.

parts_assembly Table
Column Name	Type
part	string
finish_date	datetime
assembly_step	integer
parts_assembly Example Input
part	finish_date	assembly_step
battery	01/22/2022 00:00:00	1
battery	02/22/2022 00:00:00	2
battery	03/22/2022 00:00:00	3
bumper	01/22/2022 00:00:00	1
bumper	02/22/2022 00:00:00	2
bumper		3
bumper		4
Example Output
part	assembly_step
bumper	3
bumper	4
Explanation
The bumpers in step 3 and 4 are the only item that remains unfinished as it lacks a recorded finish date.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

(Sourced from Tesla)

SELECT part, assembly_step
FROM parts_assembly
WHERE finish_date IS NULL

Assume you're given the table on user viewership categorised by device type where the three types are laptop, tablet, and phone.

Write a query that calculates the total viewership for laptops and mobile devices where mobile is defined as the sum of tablet and phone viewership. Output the total viewership for laptops as laptop_reviews and the total viewership for mobile devices as mobile_views.

Effective 15 April 2023, the solution has been updated with a more concise and easy-to-understand approach.

viewership Table
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
device_type	string ('laptop', 'tablet', 'phone')

129	phone	02/09/2022 00:00:00
145	tablet	02/24/2022 00:00:00
Example Output
laptop_views	mobile_views
2	3
Explanation
Based on the example input, there are a total of 2 laptop views and 3 mobile views.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

(Sourced from New York Times)

SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN device_type = 'laptop' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS laptop_views,

Companies often perform salary analyses to ensure fair compensation practices. One useful analysis is to check if there are any employees earning more than their direct managers.

As a HR Analyst, you're asked to identify all employees who earn more than their direct managers. The result should include the employee's ID and name.

employee Schema:
column_name	type	description
employee_id	integer	The unique ID of the employee.
name	string	The name of the employee.
salary	integer	The salary of the employee.
department_id	integer	The department ID of the employee.
manager_id	integer	The manager ID of the employee.
employee Example Input:
employee_id	name	salary	department_id	manager_id
1	Emma Thompson	3800	1	6
2	Daniel Rodriguez	2230	1	7
3	Olivia Smith	7000	1	8
4	Noah Johnson	6800	2	9
5	Sophia Martinez	1750	1	11
6	Liam Brown	13000	3	NULL
7	Ava Garcia	12500	3	NULL
8	William Davis	6800	2	NULL
Example Output:
employee_id	employee_name
3	Olivia Smith
The output shows that Olivia Smith earns $7,000, surpassing her manager, William David who earns $6,800.

Assume you have an events table on Facebook app analytics. Write a query to calculate the click-through rate (CTR) for the app in 2022 and round the results to 2 decimal places.

Definition and note:

Percentage of click-through rate (CTR) = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions
To avoid integer division, multiply the CTR by 100.0, not 100.
events Table:
Column Name	Type
app_id	integer
event_type	string
timestamp	datetime
events Example Input:
app_id	event_type	timestamp
123	impression	07/18/2022 11:36:12
123	impression	07/18/2022 11:37:12
123	click	07/18/2022 11:37:42
234	impression	07/18/2022 14:15:12
234	click	07/18/2022 14:16:12
Example Output:
app_id	ctr
123	50.00
234	100.00
Explanation
Let's consider an example of App 123. This app has a click-through rate (CTR) of 50.00% because out of the 2 impressions it received, it got 1 click.

To calculate the CTR, we divide the number of clicks by the number of impressions, and then multiply the result by 100.0 to express it as a percentage. In this case, 1 divided by 2 equals 0.5, and when multiplied by 100.0, it becomes 50.00%. So, the CTR of App 123 is 50.00%.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!
