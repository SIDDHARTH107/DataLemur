Given a table of candidates and their skills, you're tasked with finding the candidates best suited for an open Data Science job. You want to find candidates who are proficient in Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL.

Write a query to list the candidates who possess all of the required skills for the job. Sort the output by candidate ID in ascending order.

Assumption:

There are no duplicates in the candidates table.
candidates Table:
Column Name	Type
candidate_id	integer
skill	varchar
candidates Example Input:
candidate_id	skill
123	Python
123	Tableau
123	PostgreSQL
234	R
234	PowerBI
234	SQL Server
345	Python
345	Tableau
Example Output:
candidate_id
123
Explanation
Candidate 123 is displayed because they have Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL skills. 345 isn't included in the output because they're missing one of the required skills: PostgreSQL.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

WITH mycte AS 
(
SELECT candidate_id, COUNT(*) AS number
FROM candidates
WHERE skill IN ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL')
GROUP BY candidate_id
HAVING COUNT(*) = 3

Assume you're given two tables containing data about Facebook Pages and their respective likes (as in "Like a Facebook Page").

Write a query to return the IDs of the Facebook pages that have zero likes. The output should be sorted in ascending order based on the page IDs.

pages Table:
Column Name	Type
page_id	integer
page_name	varchar
pages Example Input:
page_id	page_name
20001	SQL Solutions
20045	Brain Exercises
20701	Tips for Data Analysts
page_likes Table:
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
page_id	integer
liked_date	datetime
page_likes Example Input:
user_id	page_id	liked_date
111	20001	04/08/2022 00:00:00
121	20045	03/12/2022 00:00:00
156	20001	07/25/2022 00:00:00
Example Output:
page_id
20701
The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

SELECT P.page_id
FROM pages AS P
LEFT JOIN page_likes AS PL
ON P.page_id = PL.page_id
WHERE PL.page_id IS NULL

Tesla is investigating production bottlenecks and they need your help to extract the relevant data. Write a query to determine which parts have begun the assembly process but are not yet finished.

Assumptions:

parts_assembly table contains all parts currently in production, each at varying stages of the assembly process.
An unfinished part is one that lacks a finish_date.
This question is straightforward, so let's approach it with simplicity in both thinking and solution.

Effective April 11th 2023, the problem statement and assumptions were updated to enhance clarity.

parts_assembly Table
Column Name	Type
part	string
finish_date	datetime
assembly_step	integer
parts_assembly Example Input
part	finish_date	assembly_step
battery	01/22/2022 00:00:00	1
battery	02/22/2022 00:00:00	2
battery	03/22/2022 00:00:00	3
bumper	01/22/2022 00:00:00	1
bumper	02/22/2022 00:00:00	2
bumper		3
bumper		4
Example Output
part	assembly_step
bumper	3
bumper	4
Explanation
The bumpers in step 3 and 4 are the only item that remains unfinished as it lacks a recorded finish date.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

(Sourced from Tesla)

SELECT part, assembly_step
FROM parts_assembly
WHERE finish_date IS NULL

Assume you're given the table on user viewership categorised by device type where the three types are laptop, tablet, and phone.

Write a query that calculates the total viewership for laptops and mobile devices where mobile is defined as the sum of tablet and phone viewership. Output the total viewership for laptops as laptop_reviews and the total viewership for mobile devices as mobile_views.

Effective 15 April 2023, the solution has been updated with a more concise and easy-to-understand approach.

viewership Table
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
device_type	string ('laptop', 'tablet', 'phone')
view_time	timestamp
viewership Example Input
user_id	device_type	view_time
123	tablet	01/02/2022 00:00:00
125	laptop	01/07/2022 00:00:00
128	laptop	02/09/2022 00:00:00
129	phone	02/09/2022 00:00:00
145	tablet	02/24/2022 00:00:00
Example Output
laptop_views	mobile_views
2	3
Explanation
Based on the example input, there are a total of 2 laptop views and 3 mobile views.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

(Sourced from New York Times)

SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN device_type = 'laptop' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS laptop_views,
       SUM(CASE WHEN device_type IN ('tablet', 'phone') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS mobile_views
FROM viewership

Given a table of Facebook posts, for each user who posted at least twice in 2021, write a query to find the number of days between each userâ€™s first post of the year and last post of the year in the year 2021. Output the user and number of the days between each user's first and last post.

Example Output:
user_id	days_between
151652	2
661093	21
The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

(Sourced from Facebook)

SELECT user_id, EXTRACT(DAY FROM MAX(post_date) - MIN(post_date)) AS days_between
FROM posts
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM post_date) = 2021
